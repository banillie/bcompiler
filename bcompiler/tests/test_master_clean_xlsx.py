"""
After data from the BICC forms is migrated into a compiled_master.xlsx file,
we need to avoid having to re-save this file as csv and then manually removing
all in-cell commas, so that we can create a transposed_master elsewhere in the
application, because that's a major pain in the backside. So what we're going
here is performing clean-up functions on the resulting compiled_master.xlsx
file that is created straight after the BICC forms compilation. That will then
absolve us from all hassle.
