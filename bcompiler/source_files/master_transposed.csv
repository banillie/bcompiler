In addition to the current recruitment a workforce review and behaviour plan is being produced.Work force planning is currently underway with the IDT determining both workforce and management requirements in order to deliver the scheme in line with the programme. The current analysis suggests we will have a work force that peaks at c. 2000 and a management team that peaks at 500 which includes the Highways England representatives.

The AMBER status is because the current funding in RIS1 is unlikely to be sufficient to progress the project to start of works by the end of the RIS1 period (budget = £39.6m forecast = £67.76). This is being resolved within the overall Highways England programme picking up budgets for work that supports Trans Pennine Tunnel and review of development phase and construction costs within RIS1. However the latest overall scheme cost estimate for the working assumption (2.9km tunnel) in September 2015 indicates that the  most likely outturn cost is circa £1275.7M (P50 without programme risk) £1366.4m (P50 with programme risk) against an approved scheme budget of £1380.8m (without programme risk).

Steel Procurement Narrative: This project is not expected to be publicly funded but the private sector airport developer is likely to spend well in excess of £10m on steel-based products as part of the new terminal infrastructure needed to support a further runway. This assertion is based on benchmarking with the Heathrow Terminal 5 scheme where we understand up to £150m was spent on Corus/TATA supplied steel alone. However construction is unlikely to begin until after 2020. Government will set out the national policy need for the construction of new airport capacity through an Airports NPS and therefore government may seek to influence scheme delivery. The CAA will also have an interest in efficient procurement in its role as economic regulator ensuring the passenger only bears efficiently incurred costs.,No costs are stated under CDEL as a decision on preferred scheme has not been taken and therefore full programme cost is not clear at present. The current expectation is that the scheme will be funded by the private sector.The Airports Commission assessed costs attributed to the different expansion options. The Programme have reviewed these costs and revised them for consistency with other areas of appraisal. The scheme and surface access costs for the carbon-traded assessment of need scenario (£bn 2014 prices Present Value) read as follows: LGW2R LHRENR LHRNWR Scheme and Surface Access Costs -6.0 -14.1  -16.1 Note: Work is ongoing to finalise surface access requirements and costs and the allocation of costs between scheme promoter and Government.

The figure of £19.8bn has been taken from the latest business case (2011). The difference between £11bn and £19.8bn reflects wider economic benefits of £8.8bn (2002 prices). BICC/GMPP reporting guidance from the BICC team notes that £Indirect Tax Revenues£ should be categorised as Government-Cashable benefits.There are limited negative benefits for Indirect Tax Revenues now shown separately due to updated guidance. Indirect tax revenues will be foregone as a result of less fuel paid as passengers switch from road to rail and less VAT associated with expenditure foregone to pay rail fares.

Enables the introduction of direct rail passenger services between Oxford and Milton Keynes/Bedford and between London (Marylebone) and Milton Keynes (via Aylesbury). Facilitates new passenger and freight rail markets by creating a direct link between the main radial routes from London to the west and north. A key part of this was the construction of infrastructure to enable new services between London High Wycombe and Oxford Parkway extending to Oxford in December 2016. This programme will create economically-vital new transport infrastructure to support Oxford to Cambridge Arc growth delivering faster journey times and providing new rail-based transport capacity.£Facilitates intercity journey time reductions SE to NW and strategic freight growth.

In the 2015 Spending Review (SR15) Government restated the long-term funding envelope for the HS2 programme at £55.7bn in 2015 prices. This budget is for delivery of the full HS2 scheme including rolling stock. The SR15 settlement set a year by year funding allocation for HS2 for a period of 5 years (2016/17 to 2020/21) including an allowance for inflation.In summary the total funding envelope of £55.7bn (in 2015 prices) is in Real Terms whereas in comparison the funding allocated for years 16/17 to 20/21 is in Nominal terms.For the purposes of this spreadsheet only WLC refers to the total funding envelope of the HS2 programme.  Total C-DEL spend (D74 and D75) is reflective of report period only (2015/16 - 2019/20).WLC Table below is based upon the latest assumption of capitalisation for the HS2 project.The splits provided for phase 2a and 2b are indicative and should not be taken as the basis for future ring-fencing (to be agreed with HMT as part of the SR15 settlement).

The BCR of 2.4 is currently estimated to be too high. Work is currently being undertaken to procure technical consultants to assist in re-freshing the GWRM business case. We anticipate the business case will be completed within the next 6 months. The Great Western Second Direct Award is in effect the initial procurement strategy for delivery of most of the benefits of the GWRM programme itself and represents an affordable commercially sound and sustainable way of providing the Great Western franchised services from the target implementation date of 20 September 2015 until 31 March 2019. A cost benefit analysis was undertaken in the GW Integrated Full Business Case.  NPV of 3000 (2010 £m) has been quoted above in the Cost section and a PVB baseline of 5100 (2010 £M) has been quoted as the 'Remaining Unprofiled benefits to the project' as the Business case document does not detail the benefits by years so we are unable to report this information here.  Please note that due to the Hendy replan this analysis has since been superseded by ongoing discussions with NR/GWR and modifications to the DA terms. Therefore this data has been included for reference. The new analysis has not yet been approved but there is the intention to update the business case when the Hendy baseline has been confirmed. The current intgrated business case also outlines the following NPV values which can be linked back to some of the monetised stategic outcomes under the Summary tab: Benefits - Journey time : 3400 (2010 £m),0.3,07/12/2015,31/12/2019,1,01/04/2014,,Amber,,Execute,FBC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,01/10/2013,13/07/2015,Three,,,The Programme is undergoing review by the NAO leading to a PAC in the Autumn.  This will provide close scrutiny of the Programme.  After discussion with the IPA a Gate 0 will be deferred until 2017 to avoid duplication.  Separately Network Rail is performing its own Gateway-style reviews on Programmes in the Enhancements portfolio and the results will be shared.  All actions and recommendations received from any assurance reviews and approvals bodies will be tracked and progress monitored with regular reporting to the SRO.  A GIAA Review was carried out in April 2015 which made a number of recommendations.  Since then a new governance structure has been established between DfT and NR which allows greater joint assurance of the programme and the structure of Programme and Portfolio boards enables the SRO to monitor progress carefully.  The Hendy review examined the work contained in the Programme and has re-baselined and redefined the scope.

External funding figures (e.g. third party contributions renewal contributions maintenance costs additional rolling stock costs) have not been included.  Most of the projects were included in the Rail Investment Strategy (HLOS) which was generally considered to have reached SOBC stage although some projects have been built and some are still being planned.  Work is ongoing to align the programme with the appropriate approvals processes to get to FBC status.  There are  cost escalation concerns emerging around power supply and new electrification standards.  It is anticipated that the cost of the West Coast Power Supply Upgrade will move into this programme in the next reporting period.  Note that funding for the programme after 2019 is not yet committed.  The TRU will be subject to approval of a final business case in early 2018 once a single option has been selected.

Within this there are concerns regarding escalating costs particularly on the Network Rail portion of the works. Increased scrutinity and measures to help control costs are being implemented.Schedule - At the end of Period 2 in 2016 Crossrail (CRL) is reporting 75% complete against a plan of 76.6% a variance of 1.6%. The Surface Works delivered by Network Rail are now 65% complete. The Master Operations Handover Schedule (MOHS) was launched during April 2015 and replaces the Master Control Schedule (MCS) as the primary schedule. This is expected to improve the strategic management and integration of activities necessary to deliver Crossrail as an end-to-end railway.Tunnelling Progress -  Now complete. Stations and tunnels fit-out - The focus continues on the handover to system wide contractors and with this work is underway on the tunnel and station fit out works. Rolling Stock - A recovery plan is in place in response to falling behind the schedule for cab manufacture. Full recovery to schedule is forecast for 1 October 2016. Emerging issues arising with installation of signalling software for trains running on Heathrow Spur that could impact commencement of services to Heathrow in May 2018. This has been escalated between TfL and Bombardier senior management with regular reports being provided to DfT. Dates for unit testing at Derby Old Dalby and On Network being held. Key Risks - The cost escalation risk mentioned above can be broken down to the risk that engineering contracts are not in line with Crossrail Ltd forecasts and that escalation of Network Rail costs result in the need for DfT  to provide additional funding.

Cost - Phase 1 NR has confirmed a cost escalation of £48.3m (12/13) in excess of budget as a result of delays in obtaining consent from Oxford City Council and additional scope required under planning conditions. NR identified £11.5m of cost savings by de-scoping elements of the EWR programme. Programme Board met on 22 June and approved the £11.5m of savings and recommended that the remaining gap is considered by Portfolio Board. Phase 2 no budget set beyond GRIP 4 (single option development) in CP5. Key Risks - Phase 1: late handover to operator resulting in operator claims. Planning conditions imposed by Oxford City Council including noise mitigation and the number of trains that can operate could impact on programme delivery if not resolved Phase 2: no budget being available for completion - stakeholder aspirations that Phase 2 will be delivered in CP5.

The figures do not include funding for Depots & Stabling or any contributions from other funding sources including any EU funding renewals expenditure third party funding or from other funding sources.The budget lines reflect the Hendy baseline figures for the Network Rail enhancement programme as of December 2015. The actual figures include Network Rail Period 2 (May 2016) forecasts. The variance in budget vs actual/forecast reflects the increase of £90m reported in early 2016 some of which has been through change control. A remaining change control is due to to go through the joint Network Rail and DfT governance returning this forecast back to the base and should be reflected in the next update. We expect the SRO finance confidence to return to 'Green' in the next update (Q2).,At the time the Hendy funding envelope was set to 133.5 million pounds for the ETCS cab fitment fund the scope had not been fully defined to match the new budget and so budget was spread evenly amongst the 3 remaining years of CP5.  The forecast figures based on the new scope and budget of the fund show less spend in 16/17 and 17/18 with greater spend in 18/19.Fitment of passenger train fleets will be funded and reported through franchising.CP6 spend has been left at 0 in the above table as no agreements have yet been made on how any CP6 budget will be spent.

Mitigations to reduce delay under assessment during July 2016. GW Change Team kept informed as existing fleet needs to be kept longer. 2.  Industrial relations problems associated with changing work practices. Response lead by TOCs and dormant at present. Kept under review in context of GTR. 3. Train design does not meet specification. Managed through monthly Delivery Review with Agility Trains and Hitachi. DfT's speciliast technical advisors used for assurance that the train meets our requirements. 4. Dependency on GWRM particularly completion of NR test track by end September. Bi-mode variation helps reduce dependency on electrification although operating costs increase.5.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A permanent solution for Operation Stack in Kent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Work is continuing on the Options phase with an approved scope and programme of work. Four front running options one at A and three at C have been identified. In June 2015 these and the rationale for their selection were shared with Highways England Board DfT (BICC & Special Advisors) and with the Roads Minister. A proposed solution was approved by the Highways England Board in October 2015.  Approval to proceed with non-statutory public consultation was obtained from BICC on 18 Jan 2016 and consultation started on 26 Jan 2016.  The SGAR 1 was undertaken in Nov 2015 and the project was rated ""amber"" pending completion of non-critical deliverables at that time.  Funding: £29.7m of options funding has been approved and is sufficient for the remainder of the Options Phase. BICC approved an initial tranche of development phase funding in Feb 2016. A Technical Partner was appointed for the remainder of the project on 6 May 2016.  The Project is in the process of analysing the response to consulation in order to develop a Preferred Route Recommendation.Summary : The project is on track to deliver a preferred route recommendation to DfT during Q4 of 2016.  Risks 1. Insufficient political support  with the result that the project is not considered to be a priority over other investments.  Mitigation - The Project is working with DfT officials to ensure that benefits are well articulated and understood in both DfT and HM Treasury and clearly described in the Outline Business Case.   2.Objectors to the Project may seek a Judicial Review leading to dealys and additional costs.  Mitigation - The Project has consulted with stakeholders during the development and assessment of options and has strictly adhered to a consultation process which has been developed with legal advice and assured by the Consultation Institute (there is a clear audit trail of analysis and decision making). 3. The Preferred Route Annoucement could be delayed pending DfT and HMT agreement regarding financing (public v private).  Mitigation - The Project is supporting DfT in its discussions with HM Treasury and ensuring that both parties are aware of the impact on the cost and delivery schedule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LA  promoted  scheme so limited DfT involvement focused on monitoring progress attendance at Strategic Project Board etc. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,RDEL represents the ongoing cost of running the MOT system for hosting licences business service desk and continuous improvement,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The new system in its first year of operation.

The NR team have built a matrix team from existing core business teams and contracted with specialist consultants to develop their option appraisal and build the supporting evidence bases for each asset class. In addition to build cabability and provide strong leadership a new Property (subsidery) company is being established (""PropCo"") which will have 3 N.E.Ds. However NR lack the inherent skills base to delvier Green Book compliant SOBCs and OBCs without extensive support from DFT's corporate finance and policy teams. Therefore to support NR with the development of the business cases and the structuring of Deals DfT has established a core programme team and appointed individual business case leads within Corp Finance (supported by secondees from UKGI). It is the role of the business case leads to review and support the develop of the SOBCs and OBCs. The core programme teams (1XG6 1xHEO) will ensure strong engagement with a policy legal and finance leads from across the Dept and ensure proper governance supports decision making and approvals. The DFT internal structure is built around a matrix/agile programme management model. Policy legal and finance leads support the busienss case leads to interface/review/challenge the wider implications of NR's proposals. The table above shows the resourcing for the DFT compliment. The overall RAG rating for the current position relfects the quality and volume of interactions at present. The ""future"" position assumes a worst case scenario whereby NR are not able to deliver OBCs to sufficient quality as to secure approvals from RIB/BICC/HMT and therefore additional pressure to compensate or engage in the front line work falls onto the team in DFT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The DfT Shared Services Implementation Programme comprises a series of planned (tranche) migrations  to the new ISSC-1 service provision.  Originally scheduled to complete by the end of the 2014 calendar year migration delays have meant a rightward shift of all planned deliveries. The deferment of tranche-2 (DfT & DVLA - scheduled for Nov-2015) resulted in further tripartite discussions  between Cabinet Office (Framework Authority) DfT and arvato on  delivery re-planning options incorporating provision  for OGDs to exit their contracts. Those commercial discussions commenced in November 2015 have resulted in a head of terms agreement with our supplier that is in the final stages of contractualisation. Subject to final agreement DfT family migrations to an Agresso platform will cease whilst work will be undertaken to migrate the entirity of DVSA onto a shared SAP platform.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The contract for rolling stock let and being reported as on time. Infrastructure works are underway launch event was held for the start of works at Waterloo International in March 2016.  Steps have been taken through the programme board and Enhancements Portfolio Board to manage and mitigate some cost escalation (c£90m) reported on this programme in early 2016.  As a result the projected CP5 (2014-2019) cost for the programme has returned to the 2015 Hendy baseline (although the CP6 forecast cost has consequently increased by c.£30M).   The South Western franchise ITT went out on the 30 June 2016 and working closely with the franchise colleagues in monitoring impacts that may rise relating to the infrastructure programme. We are collaboratively working with Network Rail South West Trains and DfT£s Passengers Services with regards to the introduction of the Class 707 rolling stock and the gauging clearance. Site surveys to be completed to determine what works are still required to run the new rolling stock.We are also working closely with Network Rail South West Trains (SWT) and the SWT Alliance on Waterloo station£s capacity works for next year August 2017 (including circa 23 day possession).

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The project is progressing to time with the trains manufactured (by Siemens) works by Network Rail (including rebuilding of London Bridge Station) and the construction of Hornsey depot all being delivered to the programme schedule. A key milestone was achieved in this period with the first Thameslink Class 700 train entering passenger service on 20 June 2016. The operator Govia Thameslink Railway is running trains in a diagrammed service and by summer 2018 all 115 new trains will be introduced onto the expanded Thameslink network. Hornsey Depot is on schedule for completion and handover in July 2016. The Hendy Review identified a requirement to increase the Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) estimate for Network Rail's infrastructure works by £450m. The AFC increase has been approved by the DfT£s Board Investment and Commercial Committee in February 2016. A control agreement has now been arranged with DfT Thameslink Programme team and Network Rail which includes a more robust reporting arrangement and sign-off of costs issues.The £450m will increase the capital value of Thameslink Infrastructure works to c. £5bn. The programme team is closely monitoring the risk to Network Rail Cost Control this is especially important as we approach operational readiness. The main challenges/risks facing the programme are recovery of the rolling stock acceptance and introduction into operation programme the passenger facing changes at London Bridge (Aug-16)  depot facilities in the Cambridge area delivery of 20 trains per hour and 24 train per hour through the core timetable development and train operator resources. These challenges should not prevent completion of the programme in December 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the five procurements have been signed with two more on target to be signed later this year and the fifth next year.Agreements with Freight operators and suppliers were planned to be signed by Network Rail and Industry in October this year.  The timing and scope of the freight commercial agreement is being re-examined to ensure it achieves best VfM.Fitment of necessary digital signalling equipment to a test facility (Old Dalby Rail Innovation and Development Centre) is currently being re-tendered by Network Rail as the previous contractor would be unable to fit the equipment to the agreed timeframe.  This is currently the key Risk on the project as other cab-fitment activities require the test facility to be available by Q4 2018.Overall the project is forecast to come in within the Hendy set budget of £133.5m in CP5 (12/13 prices).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Live Service support desk (SIAM) and end user device and LAN support went live during Nov 2015.  During April & May the programme decided to bring together End User Computing WAN Unified Messaging Platform and Tech Refresh into a super-project entitled NED (Networks Email & Devices).  The purpose of this was to further integrate the projects ensuring a joined up approach to delivery and optimising a good end user experience.  This has impacted some of the timescales for the projects against the original Business Case.  Exception reports are to be submitted in July to re-baseline the project plans.The NED Project has now delivered new desktop / laptop devices has delivered c.1750 desktops to users so far and is currently testing other types of devices.  Deployment of laptops are planned to start in August.  It has also delivered over 2500 user mailboxes.  NED has also completed the replacement of the Capita and Atos legacy WAN services.  Only the legacy Driving Test Centre network now needs to be migrated and this part of the NED Project will be closed and handed over to Live Services to manage in the next quarter.  The Application Development Support & Hosting (ADSH) AWS (Amazon Web Services) Legacy VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) scripting is complete and AWS Legacy environments have been created in Non-Production.

The approvals process has taken a considerable amount of time and even though a contract extension is now in place until March 2018 progressing the procurement to prorgamme is critical if HE is to be ready with a New Service Provider to transition from Autumn 2017.  Even with approval granted and procurement started given the scale of the challenge the demanding timescales my assessment of Delivery Confidence would be AMBER.   From here on the pace of delivery will be relentless across the procurement transition and business change.Cabinet Office Minister approved spend control on 22/03/16 a PIN was published and an industry day held on 08/04/16 and OJEU published on 06/05/16.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There is emerging doubt about the successful delivery of the scheme.   At the time of completing this form (mid-July) we have received informal advice from Transport for London that the scheme costs have increased by £40m and that TfL is considering options which include asking the new Mayor of London whether he wishes to revoke the previous Mayor's support for the scheme.  Based on a discussion with officials (12th July) the SofS was strongly of the view that DfT must hold TfL to the agreement that they (TfL) pay all cost overruns.  He indicated that if TfL took a London-centric approach to Croxley this must call into question the Mayor's aspirations to take over suburban rail services.  The scheme was formally handed over from Hertfordshire County Council to Transport for London / London Underground Ltd in November 2015 and delivery is currently mandated by directions from the Mayor of London (March and November 2015) which include a 100% pain/gain for TfL on any increase/decrease in the cost of the scheme.  Pending completion of a scope/cost review and completion of procurement (both being undertaken by TfL) construction is due to start in autumn 2016 and complete in 2020.  Officials will be discussing the implications of the cost increase with TfL and other stakeholders.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The scheme is currently in Development Phase. The Development Consent Order (DCO) application was submitted in March 2015. The DCO examination period ended on 3 March 2016 and the Examining Authorities report was submitted to the Secretary of State on 3 June 2016.  A decision from the Secretary of State is due 3 September 2016.  Project delivery is likely once the outcome of the DCO process is known.  We have retained one of the existing designers who carried out the preliminary design during DCO to ensure that knowledge is not lost and to mitigate risks in this area. The main risks to the DCO is Air Quality and whether mitigation is required and the Transport Select Committee's report on All lane running. HE Legal and PTSD were supporting the DCO process in order to mitigate the air quality risk.  The detailed designer and contractor were awarded under the Collaborative Delivery Framework in July 2015 to maintain programme and start works once the decision is made on the DCo submission.  The contractor was asked to re-assess the DCO construction programme and review the benefits of changing this to shorten the construction period and the traffic managment lengths thereby improving the impacts on the travelling public. This work was carried out and programme 2A is considered the best option which shortens the construction period to 50 months and proposes to use a greater number of shorter length and duration traffic management to address customer concerns regarding long lengths of traffic management. A new Scheme Estimate for the Scheme has just been produced (29 June 2016) which has increased the forecast outturn of the scheme to £889.6m (central estimate including Programme Risk) from £714.5m (central estimate including programme risk).  The scheme will need approval for the new scheme estimate through IDC HE Board and BICC (September 2016) until this has been approved all costs in Financial information are based on the £714.5 estimate which hass been approved through BICC.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There are two related projects - On-train Wi-Fi and Mobile connectivity on Rail. Both featured within the Single Department Plan. Government has committed to free Wi-Fi on all trains in DfT-controlled frachises. The on-train equipment that provides Wi-Fi is reliant on the availability of the mobile operator£s signal to connect the train to the internet.  The mobile connectivity on rail project addresses this. The team has developed a TOC-led approach to be delivered through obligations in new franchises. The approach was endorsed by Ministers. We are currently developing an OBC which will include an output based specification design to focus enhancements where they will generate a financial return. The key risks are the use of the residual value mechanism in franchise as the investment could take over 10 years to pay back and the reliance on Network Rail to develop a plan for how it will provide access and services for telecoms suppliers working for train operators.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MOT Phase B delivery progress is on track in terms of spend delivery and quality. Velocity and vendor performance are consistent across all workstreams and are showing a gradual increase. The project is delivering value in the form of working software released to Live multiple times each sprint across application database infrastructure and data quality. Over 130 releases to Live have been made since the legacy MOT1 service was retired in late September 2015. A recent peer review by GDS described MOT Phase B as 'an exemplar of how to run a proper agile project' and 'one of the best agile projects we have seen in flight in government to-date' Project delivery improvement has been supported by the new Agile Governance work (commenced in January 2016). The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of this framework is now in place on MOT delivering improved controls and assurance artefacts around agile process and software delivery including delivery roadmap (replacing legacy waterfall project plans) spend tracker (tracking spend for all vendors across all teams and workstreams sprint by sprint) and release plans covering releases of software to Live. The project continued to make good progress during Quarter 1 2016/17 in delivering further enhancements to the new MOT Testing Service application. Key service improvements included delivering functionality to support the rollout of the MOT Training Education and Skills Support (MTESS) service capabilities to support CPMS robustness and SPMS ( Slot Purchase management system) users and development of limited 2-Factor Authentication for early testing with users. Alongside the delivered application improvements the project has continued to refine its service design process to ensure that new features are based on insights from data and are researched and tested with users before development starts. The team has also made good progress in reducing defects by conducting more in-Sprint testing in the development environments enabling early identification and resolution by developers prior to promotion for release. The Common Payments (CPMS) team delivered the robustness features which will improve the communication between MOT and CPMS reducing the timescales for direct debit delivery.  The CPMS code base used by MOT and OLCS are being merged and tested to deliver a single code base reducing the total cost of ownership. The WebOps team have delivered resiliency capability and infrastructure streamlining is reducing the complexity of the architecture and lowering the cost. The move from SkyScape continues with further decommissioning saving £15k/month in costs a number of data quality changes have been deployed to improve the quality of the data available to the garages including 13k duplicate vehicles de-duped 28k incorrect expiry dates corrected 13k links between DVLA and DVSA data repaired which will ensure that Cherished Transfers of these vehicles will be correctly processed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
