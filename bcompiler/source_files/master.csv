Government Policy Alignment,The A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement is clearly aligned with the Departments strategic business objectives. It is expected that the scheme will tackle congestion on the roads and improve journey time reliability improve road safety by reducing incident related delays and encourage sustainable local travel by promoting the ethos of the right traffic on the right road,The scheme supports: i) the Government's pledge to identify present and protect World Heritage Sites for future generations after signing UN's Education Scientific & Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Convention; ii) The DfTï¿½s Command Paper Action for Roads vision for the road network and transformational investment to support the economy and the environment; iii) the National Policy Statement for National Networks which sets out Governmentï¿½s vision and policy for the future development of nationally significant infrastructure projects including a vision for the strategic road network by 2040; iv) the Road Investment Strategy (2015-2020) period 1 where the scheme has committed funding status with construction to begin within this period. ,Response to the Airports Commission's Final Report.  Government decision to increase airport capacity in south-east England (December 2015).,The Crossrail programme supports the achievement of the Department for Transport's key objectives (as summarised in the Crossrail Business Case July 2011):    ,Single Departmental Plan Milestone - Extension of rail services from London Marylebone to Oxford via Oxford Parkway  -   December 2016  The East West Rail programme supports the achievement of key objectives for DfT DCLG and BIS.  The Department for Transport's key objectives are:  - Support a transport system that is an engine for economic growth but one that is also greener and safer and improves quality of life in our communities. - Improve the links that help to move goods and people around. - Secure the sustainability of the railway and create capacity for improvement of services.,"The project fulfils the Secretary of State's rail investment strategy (also known as HLOS) capacity requirement published in 2012 for this area of the network as well as the Manifesto Commitment ""between the years 2014 and 2019 over ï¿½38 billion will be invested in Britainï¿½s rail network across operations maintenance and renewals (OMR) and enhancements (infrastructure upgrades)"". The proposal addresses historic under-provision of capacity to meet current demand as well as forecast demand in CP5.  By 2018/19 it is estimated that almost 50% more seats would be needed in the peak morning period into Paddington to accommodate forecast demand (HLOS). Single Departmental Plan 2015-2020 -  Boosting economics growth and opportunity and building a One Nation Briton by delivering rail enhancements and investing in the region to improve connections to the South West.",The development of High Speed 2 features prominently in manifesto commitments and forms part of the DfTï¿½s business plan. ,and tackle congestion - IEP will deliver more trains with more seats and faster journeys improving connectivity to and from London and between cities. Support regional economic developments - IEP creates 730 new skilled jobs at Newton Aycliffe in the North East and secures thousands more in the UK supply chain.Make the most of our current infrastructure - IEP uses the electrified railway fully by minimising diesel operation under the wires. The bi-mode capability enables locations off the wires to enjoy the benefits of an electric railway as passengers won't need to change trains and journey times are reduced.,Following a DfT-led public consultation in 2013 the need for a new road crossing in the Lower Thames region was included in the National Infrastructure Plan in 2014.  In addition to addressing the problems caused by congestion and unreliable journeys improvements in road crossing capacity are also required to support economic growth and improve environmental impacts.,The Midland Main Line programme is a Tier 1 programme that is part of the Government's manifesto commitment to deliver over ï¿½38 billion of investment in Britainï¿½s rail network across operations maintenance and renewals (OMR) and enhancements (infrastructure upgrades). ,Supports the manifesto commitment with respect to the Northern Powerhouse. Support the regional economic developments- improve efficiency spread demand increase standards  in customer services railway performance and station facilities-improve social inclusion accessibility and modern integration.,Improve the Rail Network and deliver better services to customers by addressing the high running cost of the UK railway compared with other countries; making the most of our current infrastructure; continue to invest in infrastructure such as Crossrail the Intercity Express Programme electrification of the network and tube upgrades and securing improvements to passenger rail services through a programme of rail franchise replacements.  ,The provision of this service is a commitment for the UK Government under the 1979 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation.  In order to meet this obligation and ensure service continuity DfT has successfully put in place a new service completing the military withdrawal in Jan 2016.,lementation Programme is a key plank in the Government's next generation shared service strategy and Civil Service Reform Plan. Divestment of the DfT Shared Service Centre to Arvato in 2013 was the first step in forming the first Independent Shared Service Centre (ISSC1) for providing back office service for DfT and other Government Departments. The Department is now working with the contractor for the migration of its Agencies to a new lower cost enterprise planning (ERP) solution (Agresso).,"The programme is part of the manifesto commitment to ""Improve connections to the South West with major investment in the M5 A358 A30 A303 and the electrification of the Great Western Main Line and bring in new fast trains on the route"". The project together with the related infrastructure works at Waterloo and along the South West Route fulfils the Secretary of State's rail investment strategy (also known as HLOS) capacity requirement published in 2012 for this area of the network. If data is shown in a comparable way these are the most overcrowded train services in Great Britain and are forecast to have continuing high levels of growth. The proposal addresses historic under-provision of capacity to meet current demand as well as forecast demand in CP5.  This is a key concern for SWT.",The Thameslink Programme supports the achievement of the department's key objectives as summarised in the Full Business Case (May 2013):-Tackle capacity constraints grow new markets and support wider housing and economic development plans. Improve efficiency spread demand reduce costs and increase the long term value of the railway - Increase standards in customer services railway performance and station facilities - Improve safety and environmental outcomes - Improve social inclusion accessibility and modal integration.,In line with DfTs single Departmental Plan to roll out new technology and innovation on our transport networks we are investing in digital signalling on the railways so that we can run more services and save money in the long run.,This will enable IT service provision at DVSA to continue to support the delivery of critical public-facing services and achieve compliance with the requirements of the Government ICT Strategy. ,This procurement is in support of the UK Governments Roads Investment Strategy 2015 - 2020,LA major scheme granted Final Approval by Ministers in March 2014.
