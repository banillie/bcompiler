Creating a master spreadsheet from populated templates
-------------------------------------------------------

- Ensure all populated returns are copied to the ``Documents/bcompiler/source/returns`` directory. Ensure no other files are present in this directory.
- In a command window, run ``bcompiler`` (no arguments are required).
- The resulting master file will be created in ``Documents/bcompiler/output`` directory.
- To compare values from a previous master, run ``bcompiler --compare <PATH-TO-MASTER-TO-COMPARE>``
